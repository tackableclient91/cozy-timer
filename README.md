Hey there!

I'm so excited to introduce you to Cozy Timer, a little project I've been working on to help us all find a bit more calm and focus in our day.

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by endless to-do lists or distracted by a million tabs open? I certainly have. That's why I wanted to create a simple, inviting space where you can set a timer, get into a flow, and really concentrate on what matters, even if it's just for a few minutes.

Cozy Timer is designed to be just that â€“ cozy. It's minimalist, easy to use, and hopefully, a comforting presence as you tackle your tasks, study, or even just take a mindful break. It's all about making productivity feel less like a chore and more like a gentle, natural part of your day.

Right now, it's a "felt cute, might improve later" kind of situation, but I'm really proud of what it is so far, and I have some ideas brewing for the future. For now, I hope it brings a little bit of peace and focus to your routine.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!

Warmly,
